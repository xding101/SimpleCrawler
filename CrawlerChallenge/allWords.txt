The
founding
of
Microsoft
Paul
Allen
and
Bill
Gates
on
October
after
signing
a
pivotal
contract
with
IBM
Childhood
friends
Bill
Gates
and
Paul
Allen
sought
to
make
a
business
utilizing
their
shared
skills
in
computer
programming
In
they
founded
Traf-O-Data
which
sold
a
rudimentary
computer
to
track
and
analyze
automobile
traffic
data
Gates
enrolled
at
Harvard
while
Allen
pursued
a
degree
in
computer
science
at
Washington
State
University
though
he
later
dropped
out
of
school
to
work
at
Honeywell
The
January
issue
of
Popular
Electronics
featured
Micro
Instrumentation
and
Telemetry
Systems's
MITS
Altair
microcomputer
which
inspired
Allen
to
suggest
that
they
could
program
a
BASIC
interpreter
for
the
device
Gates
called
MITS
and
claimed
that
he
had
a
working
interpreter
and
MITS
requested
a
demonstration
Allen
worked
on
a
simulator
for
the
Altair
while
Gates
developed
the
interpreter
and
it
worked
flawlessly
when
they
demonstrated
it
to
MITS
in
March
in
Albuquerque
New
Mexico
MITS
agreed
to
distribute
it
marketing
it
as
Altair
BASIC
Gates
and
Allen
established
Microsoft
on
April
with
Gates
as
the
CEO
and
Allen
suggested
the
name
Micro-Soft
short
for
micro-computer
software
In
August
the
company
formed
an
agreement
with
ASCII
Magazine
in
Japan
resulting
in
its
first
international
office
of
ASCII
Microsoft
Microsoft
moved
its
headquarters
to
Bellevue
Washington
in
January
Microsoft
entered
the
operating
system
OS
business
in
with
its
own
version
of
Unix
called
Xenix
but
it
was
MS-DOS
that
solidified
the
company's
dominance
IBM
awarded
a
contract
to
Microsoft
in
November
to
provide
a
version
of
the
CPM
OS
to
be
used
in
the
IBM
Personal
Computer
IBM
PC
For
this
deal
Microsoft
purchased
a
CPM
clone
called
DOS
from
Seattle
Computer
Products
which
it
branded
as
MS-DOS
although
IBM
rebranded
it
to
IBM
PC
DOS
Microsoft
retained
ownership
of
MS-DOS
following
the
release
of
the
IBM
PC
in
August
IBM
had
copyrighted
the
IBM
PC
BIOS
so
other
companies
had
to
reverse
engineer
it
in
order
for
non-IBM
hardware
to
run
as
IBM
PC
compatibles
but
no
such
restriction
applied
to
the
operating
systems
Microsoft
eventually
became
the
leading
PC
operating
systems
vendor
The
company
expanded
into
new
markets
with
the
release
of
the
Microsoft
Mouse
in
as
well
as
with
a
publishing
division
named
Microsoft
Press
Paul
Allen
resigned
from
Microsoft
in
after
developing
Hodgkin's
disease
Allen
claimed
in
Idea
Man
A
Memoir
by
the
Co-founder
of
Microsoft
that
Gates
wanted
to
dilute
his
share
in
the
company
when
he
was
diagnosed
with
Hodgkin's
disease
because
he
did
not
think
that
he
was
working
hard
enough
Allen
later
invested
in
low-tech
sectors
sports
teams
commercial
real
estate
neuroscience
private
space
flight
and
more
Windows
and
Office
Windows
was
released
on
November
as
the
first
version
of
the
Microsoft
Windows
line
Microsoft
released
Microsoft
Windows
on
November
as
a
graphical
extension
for
MS-DOS
despite
having
begun
jointly
developing
OS
with
IBM
the
previous
August
Microsoft
moved
its
headquarters
from
Bellevue
to
Redmond
Washington
on
February
and
went
public
on
March
with
the
resulting
rise
in
stock
making
an
estimated
four
billionaires
and
millionaires
from
Microsoft
employees
Microsoft
released
its
version
of
OS
to
original
equipment
manufacturers
OEMs
on
April
In
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
examined
Microsoft
for
possible
collusion
due
to
the
partnership
with
IBM
marking
the
beginning
of
more
than
a
decade
of
legal
clashes
with
the
government
Meanwhile
the
company
was
at
work
on
Microsoft
Windows
NT
which
was
heavily
based
on
their
copy
of
the
OS
code
It
shipped
on
July
with
a
new
modular
kernel
and
the
bit
Win
application
programming
interface
API
making
it
easier
to
port
from
bit
MS-DOS-based
Windows
Microsoft
informed
IBM
of
Windows
NT
and
the
OS
partnership
deteriorated
In
Microsoft
introduced
the
Microsoft
Office
suite
which
bundled
separate
applications
such
as
Microsoft
Word
and
Microsoft
Excel
On
May
Microsoft
launched
Windows
featuring
streamlined
user
interface
graphics
and
improved
protected
mode
capability
for
the
Intel
processor
and
both
Office
and
Windows
became
dominant
in
their
respective
areas
On
July
the
Department
of
Justice's
Antitrust
Division
filed
a
competitive
impact
statement
which
said
Beginning
in
and
continuing
until
July
Microsoft
induced
many
OEMs
to
execute
anti-competitive
per
processor'
licenses
Under
a
per
processor
license
an
OEM
pays
Microsoft
a
royalty
for
each
computer
it
sells
containing
a
particular
microprocessor
whether
the
OEM
sells
the
computer
with
a
Microsoft
operating
system
or
a
non-Microsoft
operating
system
In
effect
the
royalty
payment
to
Microsoft
when
no
Microsoft
product
is
being
used
acts
as
a
penalty
or
tax
on
the
OEM's
use
of
a
competing
PC
operating
system
Since
Microsoft's
use
of
per
processor
licenses
has
increased
Foray
into
the
Web
Windows
Windows
XP
and
Xbox
In
Microsoft
released
Windows
CE
a
version
of
the
operating
system
meant
for
personal
digital
assistants
and
other
tiny
computers
Following
Bill
Gates'
internal
Internet
Tidal
Wave
memo
on
May
Microsoft
began
to
redefine
its
offerings
and
expand
its
product
line
into
computer
networking
and
the
World
Wide
Web
With
a
few
exceptions
of
new
companies
like
Netscape
Microsoft
was
the
only
major
and
established
company
that
acted
fast
enough
to
be
a
part
of
the
World
Wide
Web
practically
from
the
start
Other
companies
like
Borland
WordPerfect
Novell
IBM
and
Lotus
being
much
slower
to
adapt
to
the
new
situation
would
give
Microsoft
a
market
dominance
The
company
released
Windows
on
August
featuring
pre-emptive
multitasking
a
completely
new
user
interface
with
a
novel
start
button
and
bit
compatibility
similar
to
NT
it
provided
the
Win
API
Windows
came
bundled
with
the
online
service
MSN
which
was
at
first
intended
to
be
a
competitor
to
the
Internetdubious
discuss
and
for
OEMs
Internet
Explorer
a
Web
browser
Internet
Explorer
was
not
bundled
with
the
retail
Windows
boxes
because
the
boxes
were
printed
before
the
team
finished
the
Web
browser
and
instead
was
included
in
the
Windows
Plus
pack
Branching

into
new
markets

Microsoft
created
Windows
CE
a
new
OS
designed
for
devices
with
low
memory
and
other
constraints
such
as

In
October
the
Justice
Department
filed
a
motion
in
the
Federal
District
Court
stating
that
Microsoft
violated
an
agreement
signed
in
and
asked
the
court
to
stop
the

with

Various
companies
including

formed
the

Platform
Alliance
in
October
to
among
other
things
increase
security
and
protect
intellectual
property
through
identifying
changes
in
hardware
and
software
Critics
decried
the
alliance
as
a
way
to
enforce
indiscriminate
restrictions
over
how
consumers
use
software
and
over
how
computers
behave
and
as
a
form
of
digital
rights
management
for
example
the
scenario
where
a
computer
is
not
only
secured
for
its
owner
but
also
secured
against
its
owner
as
well
On
April
a
judgment
was
handed
down
in
the
case
of

CEO
Steve
Ballmer
at
the
MIX
event
in
In
an
interview
about
his
management
style
in
he
mentioned
that
his
first
priority
was
to
get
the
people
he
delegates
to
in
order
Ballmer
also
emphasized
the
need
to
continue
pursuing
new
technologies
even
if

attempts
fail

the
original
attempts
with
Windows
as
an
example

European
Union
imposed
another
fine
of
million
billion
for
Microsoft's
lack
of
compliance
with

that
the
company
charged
rivals
unreasonable
prices
for
key
information
about
its
workgroup

backoffice
servers

stated
that
it
was
in
compliance

that
these
fines

about
the
past
